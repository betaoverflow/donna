According to a survey of 601 people, 57.9 % of participants experienced communication difficulties, with 23.5 % reporting severe difficulties. Only 75.1 % of participants communicated verbally; more than half found communicating with professionals and non-familiar partners difficult. Living in the privileged galaxy of intellects and witnessing a technical revolution in everyday life it is imperative not to overlook the responsibility to utilize technology to contribute to the progress and development of society at large. Communication is the fundamental basis for any individual to live a normal life. People facing trouble in communicating with others can often be a victim of social isolation. For example, most people who are hearing disabled are also speech disabled. In an extensive research conducted in various domains, it was found that hearing impairment and inability to verbally express oneself leads to lack of equal opportunities as well as leads to problems even in everyday communication. We wanted to contribute to help this cause so we came up with Donna. For all the suits fans, you know who Donna is. For those who don't, Donna is a strong female character from a famous T.V. show called Suits. She was one person who everyone could count on and whatever the situation might be she was always there for her dear ones. With all the difficulties specially-abled people feel, we hope to never let them feel lonely and helpless having Donna by their side.

## What is it? ⛹️‍♂️
Donna is an application that always has your back. Through this hack, we want to make sure specially-abled people never feel helpless. Donna supports people with disabilities by allowing them to communicate. It has special cards for a lot of statements people might normally use and need in day to day life routines. Moreover, we have a facility for storing an identity card, emergency contact and other important information to make them feel even more secure. There is also a provision of typing your own statements and using them to communicate with others. The app uses the flutter_tts package for text to speech conversion. Both the web and app is created on flutter along with firebase for user authentication. Although Donna can help a lot of people, we especially made this to help the deaf people who find it really difficult to communicate with the outside world which leads to them not opening up to new people.
